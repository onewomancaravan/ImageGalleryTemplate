# ImageGalleryTemplate

Image gallery sample can be found here: http://onewomancaravan.net/encounters_template/

To use this: 
1) create a folder, name it 'photos', and add your images to this folder. 
2) move the 'index.tsv' file to the 'photos' folder. 
2) edit the 'index.tsv file': replace the stock image names with your own image names, and replace the accompanying place-holder text with your own image captions.
